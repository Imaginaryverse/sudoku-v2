# TAP SUDOKU

## [PLAY TAP SUDOKU](https://imaginaryverse.github.io/tap-sudoku/)

A simple Sudoku game.

Choose your preferred difficulty level and start playing!

The game keeps track of the time and number of attempts you spend trying to solve every board.

Boards are randomly generated according to some rules and based on difficulty level.

If I have done my research well, there should (hopefully) only be one possible solution for each board.

#### Frameworks and technologies:

- Vite
- React
- Typescript
- SCSS

#### Have fun!

###### Version 1.0.0
