#### SUMMARY

A simple Sudoku game.

Choose your preferred difficulty level and start playing!

#### RULES OF SUDOKU

A Sudoku board is comprised of 9 rows, 9 columns and 9 sub-grids.
At the beginning of each game a certain number of cells are locked with a value inside while another number of cells are empty.
To complete a board every row, column and sub-grid must include numbers 1 to 9 and must not contain any duplicate numbers.

#### HOW TO PLAY

Simply select your preferred difficulty level and press "START".
Tap an empty cell to incrementally change the value inside.
If you tap past 9 the cell will reset and becomes empty.
When you have populated every empty cell with a value and you believe you have the solution, press "Try Solution".
If your solution isn't correct the game will continue and incorrect values will be marked in red. Otherwise, correct values will be marked in green, the timer will stop and your statistics will be presented.

#### ABOUT THE APP

Boards are randomly generated according to some rules and based on difficulty level.
The game keeps track of the time and number of attempts you spend trying to solve every board as well as your accuracy throughout the game.

If I have done my research well and done my programming correctly, there should (hopefully) only be one possible solution for each board.
